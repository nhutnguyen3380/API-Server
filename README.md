### QCELLS API Server Project ###

* The project is an API server that helps communicate data between third parties and QSP database. This application will help with the request and retrieval of data from the database safely and securely. Information such as the products list and the white label list that contains product name, itemcode, wattage, and such are accessible. This application is available to third party clients to use to request data without direct access to the database. The API helps with management, security, and processing of data.
